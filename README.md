    - There are a few ways to install Git on macOS:

      - Using Homebrew (Recommended):
      - If you don't have Homebrew installed, open the Terminal application (you can find it in Applications -> Utilities) and run the following command:
+ Bash

+ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Follow the prompts to install Homebrew.
Once Homebrew is installed, open Terminal and run:
+Bash
+brew install git

Using the Installer:
Go to the official Git website: Git for macOS
The download should start automatically. If not, click the "Click here to download manually" link.
Once the installer is downloaded, double-click it to run.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Xcode Command Line Tools: If you have Xcode installed on your Mac, Git might already be installed. Open Terminal and type git --version. If Git is installed, it will display the version. If not, it will prompt you to install the command-line developer tools, which include Git.
